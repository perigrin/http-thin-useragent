=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use HTTP::Thin::UserAgent;

    my $favorites = http(GET 'http://api.metacpan.org/v0/author/PERIGRIN?join=favorite')->as_json->decode;

    my $results = http(GET 'http://www.imdb.com/find?q=Kevin+Bacon')->scraper(
        scraper {
            process '.findResult', 'results[]' => scraper {
                process '.result_text', text => 'TEXT';
                process '.result_text > a', link => '@href';
            }
        }
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

WARNING this code is still *alpha* quality. While it will work as advertised on the tin, API breakage will likely be common until things settle down a bit. 

C<HTTP::Thin::UserAgent> provides what I hope is a thin layer over L<HTTP::Thin>. It exposes an functional API that hopefully makes writing HTTP clients easier. Right now it's in *very* alpha stage and really only helps for writing JSON clients. The intent is to expand it to be more generally useful but a JSON client was what I needed first.

=head1 EXPORTS

=over 4

=item http

A function that returns a new C<HTTP::Thin::UserAgent::Client> object, which does the actual work for the request. You pas in an L<HTTP::Request> object.

=item GET / PUT / POST 

Exports from L<HTTP::Request::Common> to make generating L<HTTP::Request> objects easier.

=item scraper / process

Exports from L<Web::Scraper> to assist in building scrapers for HTML documents.

=head1 Methods

C<HTTP::Thin::UserAgent::Client> has the following methods.

=over 4

=item response( )

Returns the L<HTTP::Response> object returned by L<HTTP::Thin>

=item as_json( $data )

This sets the request up to use C<application/json> and then adds a decoder to decode the L<HTTP::Response> content. If data is passed in it will be encoded into JSON and supplied in as the request data.

=item scraper( $scraper )

Sets up the request to process the response through the L<Web::Scraper> object supplied. It will return the data (if any) returned by the scraper object.

=item decode( )

Returns the decoded content, currently we only support HTML (in which case we return scraped content) and JSON (in which case we decode the JSON using JSON::Any).

=item tree( )

Returns a L<HTML::Treebuilder::XPath> object. 

=item find( $exp ) 

Takes a CSS or XPath expression and returns an arrayref of L<HTML::Treebuilder::XPath> nodes.

=item on_error( $coderef )

A code reference that if there is an error in fetching the HTTP response handles that error. C<$_> will be set to the error being handled.
